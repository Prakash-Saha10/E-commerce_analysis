# üìù Data Analyst Self-Assessment Template

This project is a **self-assessment template for data analysts**, designed to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, aggregation, customer insights, and advanced analytics using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn**.  

It uses a dataset with the following columns:  
`InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country`
